# T7 evidence: the textbook palindrome CFG, read as a plain PEG, is unsound-free
but INCOMPLETE

`CFLSubsetPELConjecture` (`Cfg/OpenProblems.lean`) asks whether every context-free
language has a plain-PEG grammar. The natural first attempt for even-length
palindromes over `{a, b}` is to transcribe the textbook CFG

```
Pal → a Pal a | b Pal b | ε
```

literally into PEG surface syntax (`Pal ← "a" Pal "a" / "b" Pal "b" / ε`) and hope
Ford's prioritized-choice semantics just happen to agree with the CFG's
(unambiguous, for this grammar) derivation. They do NOT, in general — this file
formalizes why, machine-checked, as a genuine data point toward the open
conjecture (not a resolution of it).

**What actually happens, mechanically** (confirmed first by direct computation
outside Lean, then reproduced here): PEG's `/` commits to whichever alternative
succeeds LOCALLY first, with no way to retroactively ask an already-successful
sub-derivation to consume less so an OUTER pending match can complete. For a run
of identical characters, the innermost recursive call greedily closes itself off
as its own self-contained `"a" Pal "a"` (or `"b" Pal "b"`) match, which can strand
the characters an OUTER pending match still needs. The concrete witness: `"aaaa"`
is a genuine (even-length) palindrome, but `palGrammar` — this exact literal
transcription — provably does not derive a full match for it.

Exhaustive computation (outside this Lean development, not itself a proof)
found this pattern is remarkably ONE-SIDED: checking all strings over
`{a, b}` up to length 20, this grammar never accepts a NON-palindrome (zero false
positives found), only rejects some genuine ones (many false negatives, `"aaaa"`
being the shortest). That asymmetry is suggestive — it hints this specific
construction style might be *sound* in general (a real theorem, not attempted
here) even though it is provably not *complete* (which IS proven below) — but
soundness alone does not decide `CFLSubsetPELConjecture`; a complete PEG grammar
for palindromes, via any construction, is what the conjecture actually needs.

/-- What the fuel-indexed interpreter actually computes for `Pal` on `"aaaa"`,
at a fuel bound generous enough to terminate: a PARTIAL match consuming only
the first two characters (`"aa"`), leaving `"aa"` unconsumed. This is the
"innermost recursive call greedily closes itself off" behavior described in
the module docstring, computed here exactly as `mpegRun`/`pegRun`-style
functions were elsewhere in this project — via `simp` unfolding the fuel-
indexed interpreter's equation lemmas, since `pegRun`'s well-founded recursion
does not reduce under plain kernel `rfl`/`decide` (the same known quirk
documented in `MacroPeg/Divergence.lean`). -/

  exact ⟨_, rfl⟩

/-- **The headline**: `palGrammar` — the literal PEG transcription of the
textbook palindrome CFG — does NOT derive a full match for `"aaaa"`, even
though `"aaaa"` genuinely is a palindrome. Proved from the computed partial
match above, via `pegRun_complete`'s contrapositive: if a full match existed,
`pegRun` would eventually report it (`pegRun_complete`), and since `pegRun` is
a deterministic function whose already-reached answers are stable under more
fuel (`pegRun_mono_le`), it would have to agree with the partial-match answer
already computed at a smaller fuel bound — but `.ok t []` (full match) and
`.ok t' ['a','a']` (partial match) are different outcomes (different `rest`),
a contradiction. -/

/-- **T7's evidence, stated cleanly**: there exists a palindrome that a plain
PEG grammar — namely the literal transcription of the textbook CFG — fails to
recognize. This does NOT prove `¬CFLSubsetPELConjecture` (a cleverer grammar,
not of this literal-transcription shape, might still work — the conjecture
remains genuinely open, see `Cfg/OpenProblems.lean`), but it does rule out the
single most natural proof-by-construction attempt, machine-checked rather than
merely asserted. -/
theorem exists_palindrome_palGrammar_rejects :
    ∃ w, IsListPalindrome w ∧ ¬ ∃ t, Derives palGrammar (.nt PalIdx) w (.ok t []) :=
  ⟨['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], aaaa_isPalindrome, palGrammar_incomplete_on_aaaa⟩

/-! ## The complementary result: `palGrammar` is SOUND (even though incomplete)

`exists_palindrome_palGrammar_rejects` shows this construction is not a
solution to `CFLSubsetPELConjecture`. It is natural to ask whether it is at
least a *safe* approximation — never wrongly accepting a non-palindrome. The
exhaustive computation described in the module docstring found zero false
positives up to length 20; this section proves that is not a coincidence of
small inputs, but holds for every input, by induction on `w.length`. -/

palindrome — the one-line algebraic fact the induction below rests on. -/

    List.nil_append, List.cons_append, IsListPalindrome] at hp ⊢
  simp [hp]

/-- **Soundness**: whatever `palGrammar` matches is always ITSELF a
palindrome — proved by strong induction on the input length, unfolding one
layer of the grammar (`ntOk` then the `.alt`/`.alt`/`.eps` structure of
`palBody`, using `seq_inv`'s flat-existential inversion for each `.seq`,
matching this project's established style for avoiding `cases`-name-
clobbering in deeply nested derivations — see the memory note on this from
earlier PEG-example proofs) per branch, then applying the induction
hypothesis to the strictly shorter recursive `.nt PalIdx` sub-derivation. -/
